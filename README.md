### Overview

The AI-AMV Generator project was conceived with the aim of creating an Artificial Intelligence-driven Anime Music Video (AMV) generator. The core idea was to leverage the CLIP model to compute frames from input videos by comparing the similarity between consecutive frames. Additionally, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) was employed to identify scene changes and detect action sequences within the video content.
### Challenges and Results

Despite the initial enthusiasm and conceptual clarity, the project encountered challenges in execution, and the intended results were not achieved. The research, while not excessively complex in theory, proved to be challenging and somewhat cumbersome in practice.
### Future Tips

The attempt to utilize the CLIP model and SSIM for scene detection and action sequence identification highlighted the intricacies and limitations of the chosen approach. The research process shed light on the need for a more refined and nuanced methodology.
### Future Plans

Looking ahead, the project's future trajectory involves a shift from the CLIP model to ImageNet. The plan is to undertake the ambitious task of training a custom AI model, a process that will necessitate extensive data collection and labeling.
### Proposed Model

For the new model, considerations include the use of well-established architectures such as ResNet or VGG. Alternatively, there is a possibility of developing a custom architecture tailored to the specific requirements of the AMV generation task.
### FUture Probems

The upcoming stages of the project are expected to be particularly challenging, involving the collection of diverse and labeled datasets, training the AI model, and fine-tuning it to ensure optimal performance. Overcoming potential setbacks will be a crucial aspect of the development process.
